# QuickViz Improvement Recommendations

This document outlines practical improvements for the QuickViz repository, organized by area, urgency level, and implementation difficulty.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### High Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Enable CI Testing | High | Easy | Uncomment and configure the test section in GitHub Actions workflow to run tests automatically. Currently, tests are built but not executed in CI. |
| Memory Leak Detection | High | Medium | Implement memory leak detection using tools like Valgrind or Address Sanitizer. This is already mentioned in the TODO list. |
| Code Coverage | Medium | Easy | Add code coverage reporting to identify untested parts of the codebase. |

### Medium Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Expand Test Suite | Medium | Medium | Increase test coverage for core components, particularly for edge cases and error handling. |
| Static Analysis | Medium | Easy | Enable additional static analysis tools beyond cppcheck (e.g., clang-tidy) to catch potential issues early. |

## Documentation

### Medium Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| API Documentation | Medium | Medium | Generate comprehensive API documentation using Doxygen or a similar tool. |
| Implementation Comments | Medium | Easy | Add more inline comments in complex implementation files to explain non-obvious logic. |
| Usage Examples | Medium | Medium | Create more comprehensive examples demonstrating different features and use cases. |

### Low Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Design Documentation | Low | Medium | Expand the design documentation to include architectural decisions and component interactions. |
| Contribution Guidelines | Low | Easy | Add CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for code style, pull requests, and development workflow. |

## Build System & Dependencies

### Medium Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Unified Dependency Management | Medium | Medium | Standardize dependency management across platforms (currently using system packages on Linux and vcpkg on Windows). |
| Build Optimization | Medium | Medium | Optimize build times by reviewing dependencies and potentially using precompiled headers. |

### Low Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| CMake Modernization | Low | Medium | Update CMake scripts to use more modern CMake practices (e.g., target-based approach consistently). |
| Package Manager Integration | Low | Medium | Better integration with package managers like Conan (already has conanfile.py but could be improved). |

## Code Quality

### Medium Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Refactor Large Functions | Medium | Medium | Break down larger functions in the codebase into smaller, more focused ones for better maintainability. |
| Consistent Error Handling | Medium | Medium | Implement a more consistent error handling strategy across the codebase. |

### Low Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| C++17/20 Features | Low | Medium | Make better use of C++17 features and prepare for C++20 where appropriate. |
| Code Duplication | Low | Medium | Identify and eliminate code duplication through better abstraction. |

## Features

### Medium Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Cairo Primitives | Medium | Medium | Add functions to draw common geometry primitives in CairoCanvas (from TODO list). |
| Save Cairo Drawing | Medium | Easy | Add button to save Cairo drawing to image file (from TODO list). |

### Low Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Accessibility Features | Low | Hard | Implement basic accessibility features for UI components. |
| Performance Benchmarks | Low | Medium | Add benchmarks to measure and track performance of critical components. |

## Platform Support

### Low Priority

| Improvement | Urgency | Difficulty | Description |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| macOS Support | Low | Hard | Improve support for macOS platform (currently has conditional code but may need testing). |
| Windows Testing | Low | Medium | Expand testing on Windows platform to ensure feature parity with Linux. |

## Implementation Plan

To effectively implement these improvements, consider the following approach:

1. Start with high-priority, easy-to-implement improvements for quick wins
2. Integrate testing improvements early to catch issues in subsequent changes
3. Address documentation improvements alongside code changes
4. Schedule larger, more difficult improvements for dedicated development cycles

This plan balances immediate improvements with longer-term enhancements to maintain code quality while adding new features.
